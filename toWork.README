1) Hero image uploader (High impact — small/medium)
Why: Makes Showcase and Editable themes feel modern and lets users personalize their profile immediately.
Files to touch: ProfileEditor.tsx, ThemeShowcase.tsx, ThemeEditable.tsx, route.ts.
Steps:
Add a file input + preview in ProfileEditor.
Call /api/uploads/signed to get a signed PUT URL (existing route).
PUT the image to the signed URL and set config.heroBackground to the uploaded URL.
Call updateProfileConfig(config) to persist.
Edge cases: large files (client-side size limit), image type validation, show upload progress, fallback if signed route not configured.
ETA: 2–6 hours.

2) Migrate uploads to S3/CDN (Medium impact — medium effort)
Why: Scales storage and speeds delivery (CDN), necessary for public profiles and large files.
Files to touch: server/s3.ts (or create), route.ts, model fields referencing file URLs.
Steps:
Add server-side S3 helpers (signed URL generation).
Update upload route to generate S3 signed URLs.
Replace uses of /public/uploads/* with external CDN URLs in profile rendering.
Env: S3_BUCKET, S3_REGION, S3_KEY, S3_SECRET, CDN_URL.
ETA: 1–2 days (incl. testing).


3) Stripe integration and invoice payments (High impact — medium/high)
Why: Monetization & real payments — let clients pay invoices and freelancers accept money.
Files to touch: invoice.ts, app/api/payments/*, Invoice.ts, app/(dashboard)/invoices/*.
Steps:
Add Stripe server endpoints to create Checkout Sessions.
Add webhook handler to mark invoices paid.
Add UI to pay invoices and show payment status.
Security: verify webhooks, store payment metadata.
ETA: 1–3 days.


4) Auth hardening & sessions (Medium impact — medium)
Why: Improve security: rotate/refresh tokens, set secure cookies, prevent session fixation.
Files: auth.ts, app/api/auth/*.
Steps:
Review cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
Add token rotation or short-lived JWT + refresh endpoint.
Add rate limiting for login/signup endpoints.
ETA: 4–8 hours.


5) Two‑way live editor sync + autosave (High UX impact — small/medium)
Why: Make the left sidebar and inline live editor reflect the same state and autosave to the DB.
Files: ProfileEditor.tsx, ThemeEditable.tsx, profile-config.ts.
Steps:
Lift the editable user/projects state into ProfileEditor.
Pass state + callbacks into ThemeEditable.
Debounce autosave to updateProfileConfig.
Edge cases: conflict resolution when multiple tabs edit same profile.
ETA: 4–8 hours.


6) Add more polished templates & theme presets (Medium impact — medium)
Why: Templates help users quickly create beautiful profiles (Agency, Grid, Minimal).
Files: components/layouts/profile/*.tsx, ProfileEditor.tsx theme list.
Steps:
Design 2–3 new templates.
Ensure each reads profileConfig fields (colors, fonts, heroBackground, CTA).
Add live preview toggles.
ETA: 1–3 days (design + implementation).


7) CI, linting, and tests (Critical for quality — small/medium)
Why: Prevent regressions and enforce code quality.
Files: .github/workflows/ci.yml, jest.config.js, __tests__/server/actions.test.ts.
Steps:
Add GitHub Actions workflow for node build, typecheck, lint, tests.
Add unit tests for updateProfileConfig, model validation, auth.
Add basic E2E smoke test (Playwright or Cypress) for key flows (signup, profile update).
ETA: 1–2 days.

8) Accessibility (A11y) & SEO improvements (Important for discoverability — small)
Why: Profiles should be accessible and shareable.
Files: page.tsx, components/layouts/profile/*.
Steps:
Run an a11y audit (axe).
Add ARIA labels, improved keyboard navigation.
Add OG meta tags and a dynamic OG image generation (or via prerender).
ETA: 4–8 hours.


9) Analytics & error monitoring (Operational importance — small)
Why: Track user behavior and catch runtime errors in production.
Files: layout.tsx, utils.ts, server error handling.
Steps:
Add PostHog/GA snippet and event calls for profile views, clicks.
Integrate Sentry for errors and performance monitoring.
ETA: 2–6 hours.
